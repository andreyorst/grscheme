This is a WIP branch for the next version of GRScheme. This file should not be
merged directly into master once it is done, but adopted to suit current project
status. Below are thoughts on future works that will happen on this branch.

Though `0.0.*` versions and above (if any) work it is merely a prototype which
is not capable of many things because of stupid design. Recursion blows Rust's
stack, graph is not maintained well enough, performance is nice, though.

The `0.1.0` version should include several changes to the internals of the
language, that will not affect the existing abilities but rather make those more
usable. The road-map is as follows:

1. [x] More general tree implementation. Probably remove pairs, because those
       are actually not really needed. We can deal with variadic arguments
       without the dot. The dot really doesn't fit current internal data
       structure.
2. [ ] (Partly done) Iterative tree traversal. Because currently all tree
       traversal is recursive, and even more, mutual recursive, algorithm must
       be changed to at least tail recursive, which then can be turned to
       iterative form using trampolines. If iterative tree traversal is possible
       it should be preferred.
3. [x] Support for tail call elimination via graph reduction. Currently no tail
       call optimization happens when recursive procedure is evaluated. Though
       there's no stack in current implementation, the amount of memory grows
       up. So even if **2.** will be lifted we'll still have memory problem.
4. [ ] `quasiquote`, and `unquote` currently left forgotten, I'm not sure if I
       should implement those in `0.0.*` series, as it is practically useless in
       current state.

The rest should be done as well but have much lower priority level, compared to
previous list:

5. [ ] Basic module system for the language. Probably going to be imported to
       global scope with plain text namespaces as a way to go.
6. [ ] Extended syntax for different data structures like vectors and
       maps. Thought I'm still thinking on this.
7. [ ] Some support for documentation. Emacs Lisp approach seem to be nice, but
       we'll have to change it to suit plain `define` form.
8. [x] Decide if `progn` should create a scope - it should.
9. [ ] Decide what to do with traversing tree in separate threads.

# GRScheme
GRScheme, or Graph-Reduction Scheme, is a simple scheme-like language written in
Rust as self-educational exercise.  This is in **very very VERY early stages**
of development, so the information below may be not accurate. Not intended for
serious use.

## Building
Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, follow [official
guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). After Rust was installed clone
this repo and run `cargo build`:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/grscheme.git
$ cd grscheme
$ cargo build
```

To run simply use `cargo run` it is recommended to use `--release` build,
because it is much faster. Without any arguments it will start the REPL, and
with file specified as first argument it will run the file:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/grscheme hello_world.grs`
> (display "hello world") (newline)
"hello world"
$ cat hello_world.grs
(display "hello world") (newline)
$ cargo run -- hello_world.grs
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/grscheme hello_world.grs`
"hello world"
```

## Graph Reduction
Unlike many other languages, where we have to parse code and build abstract
syntax tree out of the information obtained while parsing, Scheme is a Lisp
derivative, which consists out of homoiconic S-expressions, which already form
the program tree. This means that we do not have to optimize tree, or make
complex transformations on parsing stage, and the resulting tree can be later
used directly as evaluation graph. Reducing this graph from the bottom up will
produce the result of the program.

This method of evaluation gives us certain advantages:

- We can have tail call elimination of any depth, e.g when `a` calls `b`, `b`
  calls `c`, ..., `z` calls `a`, in the tail position the amount of RAM should
  not raise;
- We can do branching by cutting down trees that we do not need, which is very
  effective;
- We can store information directly inside the tree, and tree itself will be
  garbage collector, because there's no cross references, reducing the tree
  also deallocates the data;
- Which means there's no stack or heap,
  - Except there is a heap, which is a global scope of our program where we
    store permanent identifiers as constants;
- We can parallelize graph reduction at any point of the graph and compute
  several branches simultaneously.

And this set of disadvantages:

- We're more or less locked to pure functional model of evaluation;
- We're locked to immutable data structures;
- Side effects are possible only in nested expressions;
- If we parallelize, we have to lock access to the data that we may change (well,
as in any other language).

Which I personally see as another set of advantages, because those force writing
more strict code.

## Goals
This is my experiment in writing a language without knowing much about how to
actually write one. I'm going to explore jungle map-less. Here's what I have in
mind with this project (which actually may change over time):

- Have a small and fast language written in safe Rust;
- Be a pure functional language;
- Run all procedures in separate threads, e.g.
  when evaluating `(f1 (f2) (f3))`, `f1` spawns a thread, then `f2` spawns it's
  own thread, and `f3` spawn another one. `f1` then waits for `f2` and `f3`
  threads to finish;
- Tail call elimination;
- Less parentheses in places where we should not need ones, like `cond` or `let`
- Improve (IMO) upon various things I find strange in Scheme, like `let` `let*` and
  `letrec` really should be one thing.

## Non goals
I do not plan to evolve this language into a widespread mainstream Scheme
implementation. It will not follow any Scheme standard, and I do not plan on
building community around the language.

Some of this may change later on though. Who knows.

## Syntax
The goal syntax would be something like this:

- `1`, `-1`, `1.0`, `-1.0` - numeric constants,
- `"abc"` - string,
- `'(1 2 3)` - list,
- `'abc` - symbol,
- `abc` - identifier,
- `()`, `{}`, `[]` - procedure application, except in some special forms, and
  all have equal meaning,
- `;` - line comment,
- `#` - pattern,
- `:` - pattern expansion
- `\` - escape.

Reserved characters, that are not allowed as part of names, neither by itself,
nor in escaped form:
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]` - used for procedure application, lists,
- `'` - used for quoting identifiers, and list construction,
- `` ` `` - used for quasiquoting,
- `,` - used for unquoting in quasiquote,
- `#` - used for patterns,
- `;` - used for comments,
- `"` - used as a string delimiter,
- `\` - used to escape string delimiter in strings.

## Built in procedures
These procedures are part of the language core and are written in Rust:

- [x] `lambda` - create anonymous procedure;
- [x] `define` - bind name to value;
- [x] `quote` - quote name or procedure call;
- [ ] `unquote` or prefix `,` - unquote symbol in quasiquote form;
- [ ] `unquote-splicing` or prefix `,@` - unquote list of symbols;
- [ ] `quasiquote` or prefix `` ` `` - quasiquote name or procedure call;
- [x] `cons` - create cons cell;
- [x] `car` - get first value of a cons cell;
- [x] `cdr` - get second value of a cons cell;
- [x] `empty?` - check list for emptiness;
- [x] `length` - check list length;
- [x] `let` - create local bindings;
- [x] `cond` - multiple conditional branching;
- [x] `display` - print the name's value, or values directly;
- [x] `newline` - prints newline;
- [x] `read` - used to read user input and parse it to tree;
- [x] `progn` - evaluates expression in a sequence, returns the result of the
      last one;
- [x] `if` - branching with condition;
- [x] `eval` - evaluates quoted expression;
- [x] `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` - mathematical operators;
- [x] `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=` - comparison operators;

### Procedure creation
All procedures except builtin ones are anonymous procedures and are created with
`lambda` (or `Î»`) procedure:

```
> (lambda (argument list) body)
```

`lambda` accepts list of arguments with the first set of parenthesis, the rest
expressions are treated as body with implicit `progn` around it, and returns a
`#procedure`. For example procedure which computes square of number `x` is
defined like this:

```
> (lambda (x) (* x x))
#procedure
```

We can apply procedure using extra set of parentheses around it and by providing
argument:

```
> ((lambda (x) (* x x)) 8)
64
```

The expression `(lambda (x) (* x x)` creates procedure with local name `x`
that exists only inside the scope of the procedure. So if procedure
returns another procedure, which uses the `x` name, it will be stored inside
returned procedure as value. For example:

```
> (((lambda (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y)) 1) 2)
3
```

When we apply `1` to the first lambda expression `x` will be holding the `1`
value, and will be stored inside the `#procedure` returned by `(lambda (y) (+ x
y))` as `1` thus making it `(lambda (y) (+ 1 y))`. When we apply `2` to the
resulting `#procedure` it will compute `(+ 1 2)`.

### Name definition
Names are used to hold data. Names are not variables, because those are
immutable. Since this language is pure functional, we can't assign twice to a
name without redefining it before.

Names are defined with the `define` procedure, which takes two arguments as an
input and produces `#void`. This creates two names in global scope:

```
> (define abc 123)
> (define def "def")
```

We can not use numeric constants, strings, reserved characters, and whitespace
to define name names.

```
> (define -1 -1)
;; error
> (define "-1" -1)
#error
> (define my name 22)
#error
```

The `define` procedure is scope aware, and creates identifiers inside the scope
of the caller:

```
> (lambda (x)
    (define var 10)
    (+ x var))
> var
=> error, var undefined
```

names can store any kind of information: values, strings, procedures,
symbols, patterns:

```
> (define var1 22)
> var1
22
> (define var2 "22")
> var2
"22"
```

When names are holding `#procedure` those also can be used for procedure
application:

```
> (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
> square
#procedure
> (square 4)
16
```

## Special forms
Scheme and Lisps feature some special forms, such as `if` `let` `cond` that can
have some parentheses represent not what those usually do. Because `let` and
`cond` require additional parsing rules, so their form may be changed in order
to make parsing simpler. Some forms were added in addition, like `match` to
provide more flexible branching of the program.

### The `if` procedure
Used for branching the program. The syntax is:

```
(if <boolean>
    <true expression>
  <false expression 1>
  ...
  <false expression N>)
```

`if` procedure accepts `boolean` or as first argument. Booleans are written as
patterns: `#t` `#f`, everything that is not `#t` is treated as `#f`. For
example, comparison of two numbers returns `boolean`:

```
> (= 1 2)
#f
> (= 2 2)
#t
> (if (= 1 2)
      "wrong"
    "ok")
"ok"
```

If false arm holds several expressions, those evaluated in order, and the result
of the last one is returned:

```
> (if (= 1 2)
      "wrong"
    "okay"
    "ok")
"ok"
```

Because only one of `if` arms is evaluated this is a special form.

### The `cond` procedure
`cond` is similar to `if` but has more than two arms. `cond` checks if current arm
holds `#t` in the place of the first argument, and if it is `#t` the rest of the
code in the arm is executed, and `cond` returns the value of last executed
expression as the result. If arm is holding `#f` it doesn't get executed, and
the next arm is evaluated, thus only first arm which holds `#t` will be
evaluated. The syntax is:

```
(cond <boolean arm 1>
       <expression 1>
      <boolean arm 2>
       <expression 1>)
```

For example:

```
> (cond (= 1 2) "what?"
        (not (= 1 1)) "WHAT???"
        #t "all good")
"all good"
```

Because `cond` executes its arms in order it doesn't spawn threads, and arms are
executed only when it holds `#t`, similarly to `if`, `cond` is a special form.

### The `let` procedure
`let` is used to create local bindings. `let` form should be equal to the `letrec`
form by default. The syntax is:

```
(let (<binding 1>
      <binding 2>
      ...
      <binding N)
  <body expression 1>
  ...
  <body expression N)
```

For example:

```
> (let (var1 10
        var2 (+ var1 10))
    (+ var1 var2))
30
    ```
